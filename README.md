### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Brazil.\
I enjoy developing things using Java, Python and more recently Rust.\
I have Linux as my main OS on my laptop and Windows on my dekstop, even though i've used only Linux for almost 12 years.\
I do like programming, microcontrollers and networking.
I'm also interested in topics related to audio and image processing.
