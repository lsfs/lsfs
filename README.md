### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Brazil currently diving into software architecture and network programming.
I like to develop things using Java, Python and more recently Rust.
I have Windows as my main OS even though i've used only Linux for almost 12 years (and still do through WSL).
I'm also interested in topics related to audio such as filters, speech cloning and recognition.
