### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm a brazilian computer engineer and 5-year-experienced developer working with Java, angular, microsservices and currently  at [TotemTi](https://www.totemti.com.br).\
I enjoy developing things using Java, Kotlin and more recently Rust.\
I use this github account mainly to share things I've been researching or practicing these days and my personal projects.
