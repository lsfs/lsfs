### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm a brazilian software developer working at [Mobiauto] (https://www.mobiauto.com.br) and currently in my final year at IFMT where I study computer engineering.\
I enjoy developing things using Java, Kotlin and more recently Rust.\
I use this github account mainly to share things I've been researching or practicing these days and my personal projects.
